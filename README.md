# principal-component-disaster

Create labeled surrogate data sets. Perform a PCA/Class prediction with
ovr logistic regression analysis as developed in the lecture.

(a) 4 blobs: Create clearly separable 4-blobs in 3d but also a 'disaster'
realization with strong overlaps. Study, show and compare elbow plots
and prediction boundaries.

(b) (optional) 2 touching parabola spreads as shown in the lecture, but in
3d (not 2d). Study and show elbow plot and prediction boundaries.
